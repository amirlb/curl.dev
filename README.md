# curl.dev

The curl.dev website

## Idea

This website is **not** meant to be a curl.se alternative nor to "compete" with its attention.

curl.dev is meant to have content to refer users to the correct targets for various curl development topics. Development *with* curl/libcurl and development *of* curl/libcurl.

curl.se remains the main curl website

everything.curl.dev is the curl book, which is also fine to link to for various topics
